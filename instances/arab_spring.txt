== Which event ended the Arab Spring? ==

In the info box, '''26 October 2013''' is given as the end date (with a "citation needed" tag). The only other mention of this date in the whole article is for the end(?) date for the Sudan protests. At [[Timeline of the Arab Spring]], 26 Ocotber 2013 is not menntioned at all! I think this should change. If the end date of the Arab Spring is a matter of debate, this should be told to the reader rather than giving a definite date without any further explanation.--[[User:VorerstGescheitert|VorerstGescheitert]] ([[User talk:VorerstGescheitert|talk]]) 11:57, 9 October 2015 (UTC)

The Arab spring is currently ongoing, with 3 states currently still in civil war, or are in uprising.[[User:Georgeday868|Georgeday868]] ([[User talk:Georgeday868|talk]]) 01:47, 8 November 2015 (UTC)

You need to provide a source that confirms the Arab Spring is ongoing. At the moment, there are more sources confirming it ended long ago. That those wars are ongoing is not an indication the Spring is ongoing, unless there are sources confirming this. In fact, 1 of the 3 states had already been in a war (Iraq), and the current war in another country (Libya) is separate from the war that started and ended during the Spring (during which Gaddafi died). Most sources currently refer to the ongoing events as the Arab Winter, and not Spring. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 03:40, 30 November 2015 (UTC)

==Adding social science perspectives==
This article has very little in the way of analytical social science perspectives on the causes of the Arab Spring. I'd like to bring in a bit more in the way of scholarship (rather than news articles) to help make the "Analysis" section more robust. In particular, there's scholarship regarding the role of authoritarianism in the Middle East, the economic causes of the Arab Spring (including work on [[Relative deprivation|Relative Deprivation Theory]]), the role of social media, and international relations perspectives on Western democracy promotion as it affected the events of 2011. Some of the sources I've found that could prove useful are cited below.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Sure, good idea Ian. You should feel free to dive in and do so! "Edit boldly" as they say. You've got lots of good sources to work from. --[[User:Birdbrainscan|Birdbrainscan]] ([[User talk:Birdbrainscan|talk]]) 22:17, 8 March 2016 (UTC)

:Great, thanks for the feedback. I'm hoping to add in academic analysis of the social and economic causes of the Arab Spring, focusing primarily on theories of revolution as they've been applied to the events of 2011. There's also been a significant amount of literature on trying to reframe the scholarly understanding of authoritarian regimes based on the Arab Spring; I think this would make a nice subsection under the "Analysis" heading. [[User:Ianmckeachie|Ianmckeachie]] ([[User talk:Ianmckeachie|talk]]) 21:39, 9 March 2016 (UTC)

== Need sources for Syria section ==

The section on Syria has a long narrative of several paragraphs setting out many events; it gives sources for the first three paragraphs, then none for the next three. Unless the sources for the latter three were all covered in the first three, I'm inclined to flag the whole latter half of this section as "citation needed" --[[User:Birdbrainscan|Birdbrainscan]] ([[User talk:Birdbrainscan|talk]]) 22:19, 8 March 2016 (UTC)

== Ethnic Scope ==

I'm confused by the inclusion of the subsection titled "Ethnic Scope" in the "Analysis" portion of this article. The information provided here is muddled, the sources cited are dubious, and the whole subsection doesn't really seem to be saying much of anything. This passage seems out of place, especially because it doesn't demonstrate any overarching ethnic trend in Arab Spring protests. Mightn't it be better to drastically shorten it, or to redistribute it so that ethnic information about the protests is included in the subsections on each respective country?
[[User:Ianmckeachie|Ianmckeachie]] ([[User talk:Ianmckeachie|talk]]) 21:27, 9 March 2016 (UTC)

== Concurrent events ==

I'm extremely confused by this section. What, exactly, is its purpose? It seems to be a listing of instances of global social unrest around the time of the Arab Spring, but it doesn't add any information about the Arab Spring itself. Moreover, the causal link between the Arab Spring and some of the events mentioned here (such as Occupy Wall Street) is extremely tenuous. I'd suggest eliminating this section altogether and simply providing a link to the [[Impact of the Arab Spring]] page instead.
