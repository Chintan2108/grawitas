1,0,Chris Cunningham ,2010-08-25 11:02:00,"Due to edit warring on both sides over the inclusion of certain external links, I've fully protected the page. I'll keep an eye on the discussion here to see what, if anything, gets agreed upon while the page is protected."
2,1, Alkanoonion,2010-08-25 11:14:00,"Excuse me, but why did you replace the disputed links prior to locking the page? Do you honestly feel that this is acceptable behavior on your part? Can you now see why a growing number of people, myself included, are strongly beginning to suspect that Tessera's claims of bias on the part of the Wikipedia staff are indeed justified? This is highly irregular, to say the very least."
3,2,Cameron Scott,2010-08-25 11:20:00,I can't see that in the history? As far as I can tell he locked the article on it's last current edit - which is standard practice. So I'm not sure what is 'irregular' about his actions?
4,0, Alkanoonion,2010-08-25 11:28:00,"Are you serious? He knew that those citations were in dispute. By now half of the world probably knows it, after all of this ongoing debate about it. And still, the overriding issue has not been properly addressed, nor has it been remedied. We have the approval of FisherQueen, a Wikipedia staff member, to include the citations which refer to Tessera's patch. We have highly specific citations in fact, which are indeed superior to those being used to justify the inclusion of Wesp's patch. We have unimpeachable sources and plenty of valid links. So why does this issue continue to be left unresolved by the Wikipedia staff? Anyone who is reading this would conclude that one patch does indeed seem to be getting shut out of the article, for reasons unknown."
5,4,Chris Cunningham ,2010-08-25 11:30:00,"As the large grey banner on the article says, protection of a particular revision is not an endorsement of said revision. We have to protect some revision, and it's alway The Wrong Version to someone."
6,0, Alkanoonion,2010-08-25 11:34:00,"He stated that he was locking the article until this issue had been resolved, did he not? Thus he has made it clear that he is aware of the dispute and the reasons which underlie it. To lock the page with the disputed material intact is a clear case of breach of trust."
7,0,Cameron Scott,2010-08-25 11:37:00,"When an admin protects a page due to edit-warring, the standard action is to protect it at the last version and let people settle the dispute on the talkpage. That's what Thumperward has done - if he had reverted to an earlier version that would have been taking sides and that's not permitted for an admin in that context. His actions were in line with policy. Your suggested action would have left him open to accusations of taking sides."
8,0,Cameron Scott,2010-08-25 11:45:00,"He is taking sides by not including the UGO citation which has already been acknowledged. Why does this issue continue to be ignored? You can keep telling people that black is white all day long, if you want to. But each time that you have been asked -why- the UGO reference for the True Patch, as well as a pertinent download link have not been added to the article in question, you continue to deflect the issue with rhetoric. Why?

It's not rhetoric - the protecting administrator cannot take sides by choicing one version over another, he or she is suppose to protect whatever version of the article exists when they arrive at the article. What is difficult to understand about this? if your version of the article was the last version when Thumperward had got here, that is the version he should have protected. This is standard procedure - how is it taking sides to follow our standard procedures in such situations? I do not think I can make this any clearer or simpler to understand - the protecting admin should protect whatever version exists when he gets there, nothing more, nothing less."
9,0, Alkanoonion,2010-08-25 12:12:00,"The part which I do not understand is the part where the prevailing party continues to be catered to, and the other party continues to be shut out. The proper course of action would be to remove -all- of the items which are in dispute, until an equitable solution has been reached. That's the way mature and responsible people do things in this world... unless they are operating with some sort of biased agenda."
10,9,Chris Cunningham ,2010-08-25 12:44:00,"I'm not sure why you think this is an exceptional situation. We protect pages every day in the middle of disputes, and every single time it happens someone screams that we have protected The Wrong Version (go and have a read of the page, which was written precisely because this is so common). Quite what agenda Wikipedia is supposed to have here is not clear, even if Wikipedia's admins really were being given instructions on the matter: from a look through some of the stuff written about it, apparently Wikipedia is in collusion with Activision to ensure that Bloodlines players never get to really enjoy the game... because this somehow makes Activision money? Or because the guy who wrote the other patch is slipping up brown envelopes full of money? Anyway, all we're doing here is following a protection policy which was drawn up to be impartial and perfected over far more important disputes than a bug-ridden video game. That's not going to change based on anything said here, so it would be better to concentrate on the actual substance of the dispute."
