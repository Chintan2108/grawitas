== Timeline: s/date ended/major dates/ ==

IMHO the Timeline table is a nice idea, but it needs some thinking through. i think the "date ended" column is not a good idea in the Timeline section. Even "date started" is risking POV, lack of RS. On the Algerian protests talk page, there's a comment pointing out that the protests have been going on since 2002. So what is really meant by "date started" is something like "date when protests started growing exponentially and/or were perceived by Western mainstream media to become significant". But what can we replace it with?

IMHO replacing "ending date" is easier. How about replacing this by "critical dates" or "important dates"? Maybe we could even replace both starting and ending dates by allowing maybe a max of 3 columns for critical dates? By comparing various RS's, in some cases critical dates will be obvious, and in other cases, at least it should be easier to come to consensus on the talk page regarding "which date(s) was (were) more critical given the sources we have" rather than "on which date did this ''start/end''". As more sources come in and events happen and third party analysts give their opinions on which dates were more important, the quality of the table will improve.

Someone good with tables would have to implement this. Or does someone have a better suggestion? An example could be for the Tunisian case - i'm not sure which "starting" date would count as critical, but clearly the two days when Ben Ali left and Mebazaa became acting president should count as one critical pair-of-days, and maybe the day that the new cabinet was purged of all ex-RCD people except for Ghannouchi himself would count as another critical day, though certainly not an "end date" - parliamentary and presidential elections would likely be interpreted as some sort of an end date of the change of power, but i would expect that historians would consider that fundamental social changes would take place over several years.

:I think it's difficult to assess "critical dates" at this point, and the number of columns could begin to expand infinitely. Let's just restrict to "starting dates" for now. [[User:Cjs2111|Cjs2111]] ([[User talk:Cjs2111|talk]]) 07:47, 31 January 2011 (UTC)

===country links to country article, to subsection here, or to protest article?===
At the moment, the country links in the timeline table go to article entries. My feeling is that they would better go to subsection links within this article (and/or maybe to the main articles for 2011 protests in that country if the article exists). Otherwise, someone looks at the table and thinks, hey, i want to know more about the protests in country X, s/he clicks and ends up on a general article about the country, without getting more info about the protests. Probably there's no point linking directly to the sub-articles - this is slower for downloading than just an internal subsection link. My feeling here goes for internal subsection links. If the country does not have its own subsection, then it should not be in the table anyway, which should only summarise what is in the content below.

== Comments/Recommendations/Suggestions: Re: Map, layout, overview table ==

I just had a few suggestions/comments that I hope people would consider implementing or discussing further:
*<s>I am no expert on this but would Turkey or Iran not also be under the Arabic countries (and hence should be shaded a darker colour on the map?).</s>
*In the overview section, I would suggest that there be perhaps one or two sentences before the table comes in. It seems a bit strange (IMHO) for there to be a table in section without any words or contents around it (although I admit the intro does a good job, but I still feel something should be written on top or below the table in its own section).
*This might be on the verge of WP:CRYSTAL but would it be possible to arrange the text outlining the countries in order of what happened reflected on the map (so Tunisia at the top as government overthrown and possibly Egypt below it as it might be the next country in the region to lead to the leaders/government being ousted). Then the next section would contain countries of major protests, then the section below that of minor protests. Then the countries can be moved up to their respective sections once an outcome is reached or remain where they are if nothing more significant occurs.
*Any thoughts on having an "other Arab countries" section as well (for example the UAE or Western Sahara) and mentioning background on that country of protests in the past and at the moment nothing is happening or no point?) - Kuwait seems to cover this example well on although there are no protests there, things are happening possibly in relation to this (i.e. food rationing).

You might as well call Spain part of the French world because it borders France. Your comment "Actually, it IS. It borders Syria, Iraq and Iran, and is governed by an Islamist Government, albeit a moderate one" is absurd, because 1. Iran is not an Arab country, and 2.

== My two cents, not mixing the Arab World with the Arab League ==

There is no doubt that Comoros, Somalia and Djibouti are members of the Arab League, and Eritrea is an observer but that mere fact does not make those countries part of the Arab World. Those countries have Arabs, but only as minorities, same thing with Chad and Israel to that matter, yet they are not on the map. In a historical and most importantly cultural aspect, the Arab World stops with Sudan and the horn of Africa is not included. Just take a look at a reality TV show where people call to cast their votes, and you'll notice that not one time those countries are included, and that is due to the cultural and linguistic differences. So, as an Arab, I doubt very much that these countries would be in any wave the might sweep the Arab World, and I see no point to including them in the map just because they are members or observers in the Arab League.

::Regardless of whether Somalia or Djibouti ought to be included (which I would, reflecting on their membership in the Arab League), Comoros certainly should be. In addition to Arab League membership, Arabic has its status as the Comorian ''[[lingua franca]]''. Eritrea does not consider itself an Arab nation, but has observer status out of concern for developments within Arab countries &mdash; many of which are adjacent to Eritrea and have a significant impact on the country's foreign affairs. Really, the "Arab World" doesn't necessarily have a specified political definition; one could even say it encompasses the entirety of North Africa (largely excluding Niger and Mali) and Western Asia (excluding Turkey, but including Israel for its significant Arab minority, and also Iran's western states). To put this in perspective, look at [[Chad]]. It is not a member state of the Arab League, but many people throughout the country (especially in the north) speak Arabic informally. Chad is arguably an Arab country on a cultural basis.

If you disagree with the TOC depth limit, then please discuss it here. At least one person doesn't want the table of contents to have too much structure. i can see arguments both for and against the depth limit. An argument against a TOC depth limit is that having no limit can help decide if/when a subsection needs to be split, since it's easier to see which subsections seem to have more depth. An argument in favour of the depth limit is that it avoids giving possibly arbitrary overemphasis to some countries, especially since countries with already split main articles do not have substructure in this article nor in the TOC.

The reason I bolded all of the subsections for the countries in this article is because some of them are doubled as you can see there are two protests sections one for their country the edit summary does not show this so it adds to confusion. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 04:13, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

:I think what you are trying to say is that your ''argument against subsections of countries is that the edit summaries become ambiguous''. For example, it becomes unclear in the edit summary if someone is editing e.g. Bahrain or Sudan. Checking this requires comparing the different revisions. 
:i understand the argument. i'm not totally convinced that it justifies not using properly coded headings. Also, RS info we have on protests in the different countries do not structure in quite the same way in each case, so the ambiguity will not happen in every case. However, at least we understand your reasoning, and people who feel strongly enough either way can discuss further here. Maybe someone knows a general guideline on the issue.
:i substructured (not bolded :) your == heading here on the talk page since it is a sub-topic of the previous point.

== Renaming of article proposal ==

These protests started in Iran.  Iran, as many have pointed out, is not even Arab.  So we need a new title for the page.  I've suggested:
* 2010-2011 worldwide political protests
* 2010-2011 populist uprisings
* 2010-2011 pro-democracy protests
... or any combination therein--basically anything which can open this up to Iran but also potentially Cuba or who knows, maybe Zimbabwe will get in on it. Thoughts? [[User:Ocaasi|Ocaasi]] ([[User talk:Ocaasi|talk]]) 03:01, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

:I suggest '''Greater Middle East Populist Uprisings'''. You can argue that Iran is not part of the ME, or that Algeria is not part of the ME, but it's hard to argue that they are not part of the "[[Greater Middle East]]". They are not quite at the level which deserves "worldwide" status. I may vote for that if it spreads to El Salvador or Burundi. But for now, these movements are clearly constrained to the Muslim countries in and near the Middle East.

: This is the English language Wikipedia, and in English, including in North American, South African and Australian useage, Middle East is an extremely well-established geographical description.

If any of thee protests are about people wanting no change in their government at all, just protesting against the price of food or something, take them out.

== Article reorganization ==

Because of the dynamism of the current situation in the Middle East and given the fact that there is 90% probabilities it will escalate I propose for the article [[2010-2011 Pro-democracy protests]] to be reorganized in the following way:<br>
--Name of country--
::Hatnote to main article
:Small introductory paragraph
::Link to timeline of the protests inside that country as a stand alone article.
I also think there should be a major timeline of the most important protests in this main article. Thanks --[[User:Camilo Sanchez|Camilo Sanchez]] ([[User talk:Camilo Sanchez|talk]]) 21:15, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

== italy protests ==

italy has veen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2010%E2%80%932011_Middle_East_protests&diff=413734353&oldid=413734088 reverted] pending discussion. the revolt over there doesnt seem the least bit related (or have any parallels veen made). we cant add ALL protests that happen concurrently.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 19:10, 13 February 2011 (UTC)

:Berlusconi seemed quite desperate to defend Ben Ali AFAIR, and the peoples on the north and south sides of the Mediterranean have had strong social/cultural/political interactions/relations for thousands of years. i think the hypothesis that Italians were re-motivated to protest by the south-of-the-sea revolutions is reasonably credible. Berlusconi holds a near monopoly on private and state television (AFAIR), so that's not so far from being a dictator. On the other hand, my arguments in the previous talk section still apply. Encyclopedic knowledge about a network - human society - has to be divided up in some ways in order to fit conveniently in encyclopedia pages, even if they're electronic. The best efforts at being NPOV + RS about this are what we need. If someone finds enough RS who claim that there's a pattern in the [[2010–2011 African-European-Asian protests]], then maybe try starting that page. Don't expect it to be easy - it might even get a speedy delete. Wait 12-24 months and if Africa-Europe-Asia has undergone a widespread revolutionary fervour (maybe North America too?), then new pages would be justified. [[User:Boud|Boud]] ([[User talk:Boud|talk]]) 22:32, 13 February 2011 (UTC)

:i just looked at the "concurrent protests" section. Italy is not the only country with no RS claim to being inspired by the Tunisia/Egypt revolutions in the present version {{sec link auto|en|2010%E2%80%932011_Arab_world_protests|query=oldid=413763654}}:
:*Albania - literally, the 150 injured protestors (= "the latter") stated that they were trying to carry out Tunisia-style unrest; guessing what is really meant, this was only the prime minister trying to use Tunisia as a criticism
:*Bolivia - source 174 only says "Popular pro-democracy protests in Tunisia, Egypt and other parts of the Middle East have put Latin American rulers on guard and Morales ... " - this is a vague association - protests overthrowing rulers in Latin America, mostly with electoral followups, have been happening for about two decades there.
:*Ethiopia - i didn't check the source, but i don't see any Tunisia-Egypt link in the wikipedia text at all
:*Former Soviet Union - sourced crystalballing seems a bit weak for an entry here
:*Serbia - no link with Tunisia/Egypt at all in the text

:Almost all of this should go to some other page like [[List of anti-national-government protests in 2011]]. Excluding Italy in the context of the Albania/Bolivia/Ethiopia/Former Soviet Union/Serbia entries makes it sound like the subsection title should be '''Similar concurrent protests in non-Western countries outside the Arab world'''.

The only other alternatives that deals with the subject accurately is probably "Muslim World" or "Greater Middle East", but those names don't seen to be gaining a lot of traction due to some (what I believe to be unsubstantiated) accusations of "Eurocentrism". I still hold that Iran alone does not suddenly change the nature of the protests to something global.

::::WHAT? consensus was there before the move to what is currently is. if anything consensus is NOT at its current state. again and again the regular editors of this page are in full agreement that the current versin is WRONG.--[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 23:22, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

This is really non-controversial. Go to Google News, and search for:

* arab world protests
* pro-democracy protests

Restricted to "Past month", the first search yields 22,600 results, while the second only 12,400. So I'd say the consensus in the worldwide English-language media (ie, Reliable Sources) is for the article title we had at the beginning.

:Yeah well, I tried but leave it to this [[User_talk:Dabomb87#2010.E2.80.932011_Pro-democracy_protests|User]] to lock the article and prevent the move, he says he is "reading around" to "see" if there is consensus. --[[User:Camilo Sanchez|Camilo Sanchez]] ([[User talk:Camilo Sanchez|talk]]) 23:27, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

::I am well aware that I protected the [[WP:WRONG|"wrong" title]]. However, no consensus will ever be reached if users continue to move the article to their preferred name and refuse to discuss.

:::You were right to protect it, as the well-meaning but overzealous user Camilo fomented another edit war. That had to stop.
:::Users here, please, just do this: Make a list of the most popular titles, and ask everyone here to comment on them. Then we can get consensus and get the "right" title in place quickly. And if someone messes with it after that, unilaterally, ask that they be blocked for disruption. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 23:33, 15 February 2011 (UTC)

This situation is absurd. The unilateral action by one editor appears to be rewarded, based on the logic that there would be no consensus for moving the article to some other place.&nbsp;<span style="border:1px solid;color:#000085">&nbsp;[[User:Cs32en|<font style="color:#000085;">'''Cs32en'''</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Cs32en|<font style="color:#000085;"><small>Talk&nbsp;to&nbsp;me</small></font>]]&nbsp;</span> 23:36, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
::to give credit EVERYWHERE its due. the lock was appreciated big time. but camillo's move was NOT unilateral it was based on consensus of participatory editors. the ?right" title is ALWAYS what consensus is agreed, and i was not part of the consensus that ageed to the move yt i support ''consensus''. ''cs32eb'' was on the all we cant reward one nutcase taht everyone disagrees with is and is , quite franyl, a this point NOT AGF.--[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 23:45, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
:::I don't disagree with Camilo's sentiment in the matter, but he should not have fomented another edit war. I think this matter will be cleared up soon and then all will be swell. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 23:49, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
::::Yeah, I screwed up the move with a copy and paste. It was a desperation move (a la [[The King of Fighters|KOF]]). But the only one to blame here is whoever made the move to "pro democracy" in the first place. --[[User:Camilo Sanchez|Camilo Sanchez]] ([[User talk:Camilo Sanchez|talk]]) 23:53, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
